# Two-Balls
A simple Pygame simulation where two falling circles bounce and collide. Control the red circle with arrow keys and spacebar. Perfect for beginners learning basic physics and movement in Pygame.

# Pygame Collision Simulation

This is a simple Pygame project that simulates the motion, collision, and interaction between two falling circles in a 2D space. The red circle can be controlled using keyboard inputs, while both circles bounce when they hit the ground. Collision detection prevents overlap when the circles collide.

## Features

- **Gravity and Bouncing:** Both circles fall under gravity and bounce off the ground.
- **Collision Detection:** The circles detect collisions and adjust their positions accordingly.
- **Player Control:** Move the red circle left or right with the arrow keys and make it jump using the spacebar.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame

To install Pygame, run:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Running the Project

1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Navigate to the project folder in a terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the following command:

```bash
python <filename>.py
```

## Controls

- **Left Arrow Key:** Move the red circle left.
- **Right Arrow Key:** Move the red circle right.
- **Spacebar:** Jump the red circle.
